Inspiration

As university students, we face some of the most stressful challenges: applying for jobs, studying for exams, and managing tight assignment deadlines. These pressures made us resonate with the topic of stress. We wanted to create something that could make our lives easier by saving us time, helping us structure our days, and ultimately reducing stress as much as possible.
What it does

ClearCal simplifies your day by combining AI task generation with seamless Google Calendar integration, so your schedule is always in sync. And to save even more time, our text-to-speech feature allows you to interact with the app hands-free, making task input and updates effortless. We focus on your priorities and mental well-being to create a balanced, stress-reducing schedule that works for you.
How we built it

We built ClearCal using a React Web App, the Google Gemini API, and Google Calendar integration with OAuth.
Challenges we ran into

Perfecting our prompts was a huge task to optimize the app, formatting the prompts as well, (Gemini doesn't return JSON). Another challenge would be coming up with ideas to save the most possible time, and relieving the user of having to input information manually.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We set out to accomplish three major goals in a very short amount of time, goals we initially thought would be future features. These goals were: implementing speech-to-text functionality for hands-free input, creating detailed subtasks and action plans to break down tasks, and seamlessly integrating with a userâ€™s Google Calendar to ensure their schedule stays in sync.
What we learned

Prompt engineering, Team communication and collaboration, React & web development principles, google oAuth integrations, using API's, cleaning data.
What's next for ClearCal

Weekly/Monthly Scheduling, analyzing user's monthly stress patterns by storing their data in a database, and integrations with other calendars like Outlook.
